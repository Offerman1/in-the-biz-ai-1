# In The Biz AI - Copilot Instructions

**Knowledge cutoff:** June 2024
**Current date:** December 31, 2025

**These instructions are automatically applied to every Copilot chat session.**

---

## 📝 DOCUMENTATION RULE

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT add implementation details, feature summaries, or "how things work" documentation to these copilot instructions.

**Where to document instead:**
- **Feature completion:** Update `docs/MASTER_ROADMAP.md`
- **Implementation guides:** Add to relevant phase docs in `docs/phases/`
- **New features:** Document in `docs/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` (if not started) or roadmap (if completed)
- **Technical specs:** Create dedicated docs in `docs/` folder

**These copilot instructions should ONLY contain:**
- Critical workflow rules (device IDs, deployment commands, theme rules)
- Things the AI MUST remember every session
- Rules that prevent breaking the app (like "never hardcode colors")

## 📱 DEVICE CODE FOR ANDROID PHONE

**User's Android Device:** Samsung Phone (Seeker)
**Device ID:** `SM02G4061996968`
**IP Address:** `10.0.0.65`

**To run the app on the user's phone:**
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Brandon 2021\Desktop\In The Biz AI" ; flutter run -d SM02G4061996968
```
**To run the app wirelessly:**
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Brandon 2021\Desktop\In The Biz AI" ; flutter run -d 10.0.0.65:5555
```

**User's Android Tablet:** Samsung Galaxy Tab (SM X210)
**Tablet ID:** `R92X3069WGW`
**IP Address:** `10.0.0.50`

**To run the app on the user's tablet:**
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Brandon 2021\Desktop\In The Biz AI" ; flutter run -d R92X3069WGW
```

**Running Multiple Devices Simultaneously:**
- Flutter can only run one device per terminal session.
- Open two separate terminals or use VS Code's split terminal (`Ctrl+Shift+5`) to run both devices simultaneously.
- When you press `r` (hot reload) in either terminal, it will reload **only that device**. But when you **save a file** in VS Code, both devices will hot reload automatically at the same time.
- **Save file (Ctrl+S):** Both devices reload 🔄🔄
- **Press `r` in Terminal 1:** Only phone reloads 🔄
- **Press `r` in Terminal 2:** Only tablet reloads 🔄
- **Press `R` (capital):** Hot restart for that specific device
- **Press `q`:** Quit that specific device
- Hitting **Ctrl+S** will trigger a hot reload on both devices. It's a handy trick when you want to manually reload everything without making an actual code change.
- You can also just add a space somewhere and then delete it, then hit save - Flutter will reload both devices even though nothing actually changed in the code.

**Wireless Debugging Setup (ADB over Wi-Fi) (NEW - December 29, 2025):**

These steps allow for wireless debugging, avoiding USB cable issues.

**Prerequisites:**
1.  Android SDK Platform-Tools installed.
2.  USB debugging enabled on your Android device.
3.  Both your computer and Android device connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

**Setup Steps:**

1.  **Connect Device via USB:** Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable.

2.  **Enable TCP/IP Mode:** Run the following command in the terminal, replacing `<device_id>` with your device's ID (obtained from `adb devices`):
    ```powershell
    C:\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe -s <device_id> tcpip 5555
    ```
    Example:
    ```powershell
    C:\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe -s SM02G4061996968 tcpip 5555
    ```

3.  **Find Device IP Address:** On your Android device, go to **Settings** → **About phone** → **Status** → **IP address** or **Settings** → **Connections** → **Wi-Fi** → tap your connected network.

4.  **Connect via Wi-Fi:** Run the following command, replacing `<device_ip_address>` with the IP address you found:
    ```powershell
    C:\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe connect <device_ip_address>:5555
    ```
    Example:
    ```powershell
    C:\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe connect 10.0.0.98:5555
    ```

5.  **Verify Connection:** Run `flutter devices` to see your device listed as `<device_ip_address>:5555`.

6.  **Run Wirelessly:** Deploy your Flutter app wirelessly using:
    ```powershell
    cd "c:\Users\Brandon 2021\Desktop\In The Biz AI" ; flutter run -d <device_ip_address>:5555
    ```
    Example:
    ```powershell
    cd "c:\Users\Brandon 2021\Desktop\In The Biz AI" ; flutter run -d 10.0.0.98:5555
    ```

**Batch File for Easy Reconnection:**

Create a batch file (e.g., `connect-wifi.bat`) with the following content, replacing the IP addresses with your device's IPs:

```bat
@echo off
REM All device IP addresses
set TABLET_IP=10.0.0.50
set SEEKER_IP=10.0.0.65
set SN339D_IP=10.0.0.98
set ADB_PATH=C:\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe

echo Connecting all devices over Wi-Fi...
echo.
echo Connecting Tablet (SM X210)...
%ADB_PATH% connect %TABLET_IP%:5555
echo.
echo Connecting Seeker Phone...
%ADB_PATH% connect %SEEKER_IP%:5555
echo.
echo Connecting SN339D Phone...
%ADB_PATH% connect %SN339D_IP%:5555

echo.
echo Available devices:
%ADB_PATH% devices

echo.
echo To disconnect all: adb disconnect
pause
```

**How to Run the Batch File:**

*   **From File Explorer:** Navigate to your project folder (`In The Biz AI`) and double-click `connect-wifi.bat`.
*   **From VS Code Terminal:** Type `connect-wifi.bat` and press Enter.

**When to Use the Batch File:**

*   After restarting your phone/tablet.
*   After disconnecting from Wi-Fi.
*   When `flutter devices` doesn't show the wireless devices.

**Device-Specific Wireless Run Commands:**

*   Tablet: `flutter run -d 10.0.0.50:5555`
*   Seeker: `flutter run -d 10.0.0.65:5555`
*   SN339D: `flutter run -d 10.0.0.98:5555`

**Making IP Addresses Permanent (DHCP Reservation):**

1.  Log into your router (usually `192.168.1.1` or `10.0.0.1` in a browser).
2.  Find **DHCP Reservation** or **Static IP Assignment**.
3.  Reserve these IPs for each device's MAC address:
    *   Tablet: `10.0.0.50`
    *   Seeker: `10.0.0.65`
    *   SN339D: `10.0.0.98`

**Important Notes:**

*   Keep both devices on the same Wi-Fi network.
*   The first connection requires USB (for enabling TCP/IP mode).
*   IP address may change - if the connection fails, check your IP and update the batch file.
*   Wireless debugging uses more battery than USB.

## 🎨 THEME SYSTEM - CRITICAL RULES (UPDATED December 30, 2025)

**NEVER use hardcoded colors. ALWAYS use AppTheme.**

### General Theming Philosophy (NEW - December 30, 2025):
- Professional apps use a **primary accent color** (green, purple, blue) but keep most of the UI **neutral** (whites, grays, blacks) so the accent color **pops** instead of overwhelming everything.
- Use the accent color **sparingly** - for buttons, highlights, gradients, and key interactive elements.
- **Backgrounds should be neutral** (almost black - `#0D0D0D`) in dark themes to make the colored containers pop.

### Color Usage Rules:
**✅ CORRECT:**
```dart
Container(
  color: AppTheme.primaryGreen,
  child: Icon(Icons.add, color: AppTheme.textPrimary),
)
```

**❌ WRONG:**
```dart
Container(
  color: const Color(0xFF00D632),  // NEVER hardcode
  child: Icon(Icons.add, color: Colors.white),  // NEVER use Colors.xxx
)
```

### Available Theme Colors:
- **Primary:** `AppTheme.primaryGreen` (main brand color - changes with theme)
- **Backgrounds:** `AppTheme.darkBackground`, `AppTheme.cardBackground`, `AppTheme.cardBackgroundLight`
- **Text:** `AppTheme.textPrimary`, `AppTheme.textSecondary`, `AppTheme.textMuted`
- **Accents:** `AppTheme.accentRed`, `AppTheme.accentBlue`, `AppTheme.accentYellow`, `AppTheme.accentOrange`, `AppTheme.accentPurple`
- **Semantic:** `AppTheme.successColor`, `AppTheme.warningColor`, `AppTheme.dangerColor`, `AppTheme.scheduledShiftColor`
- **Charts:** `AppTheme.chartGreen1`, `AppTheme.chartGreen2`, `AppTheme.chartGreen3`
- **Gradients:** `AppTheme.greenGradient`
  // Hero card background - always dark, even in light themes
- **Hero Card:** `AppTheme.heroCardBackground`

### How Theming Works:
1. User selects theme in Settings → Appearance (11 themes available)
2. Theme saved to database via `ThemeProvider.setTheme()`
3. App automatically restarts and loads new theme from database
4. `ThemeProvider` updates `AppTheme.setColors()` with theme-specific colors
5. **ALL colors update** - buttons, text, charts, badges, everything

### Available Themes:
**Dark Themes:**
- Finance Green (Default) - Classic green finance app
- Midnight Blue - Professional blue tones
- Purple Reign - Royal purple
- Ocean Breeze - Teal/aqua
- Sunset Glow - Orange/warm tones
- Forest Night - Nature green
- PayPal Blue - PayPal-inspired
- Finance Pro - Crypto blue/purple

**Light Themes:**
- Light Mode - Classic white background with emerald green accent
- Finance Light - PayPal-inspired blue theme with off-white background
- Soft Purple - Gentle purple theme

### When Creating New UI:
- **NEVER** use `Colors.green`, `Colors.blue`, `Color(0xFFXXXXXX)`, etc.
- **ALWAYS** use `AppTheme.primaryGreen`, `AppTheme.accentBlue`, etc.
- If you need opacity: `AppTheme.primaryGreen.withOpacity(0.5)`
- For text on colored backgrounds: `AppTheme.primaryOnDark` or `AppTheme.textPrimary`
- For AppBar titles and other text directly on backgrounds, use `AppTheme.adaptiveTextColor` to automatically adjust to the current theme.
- **Hero Card Backgrounds:** Hero cards must maintain their dark background even when in Light Mode. Use `AppTheme.heroCardBackground` which is **ALWAYS** the pure black color (`#000000`), regardless of whether you're in Light Mode or any other theme.
- **Hero Card Gradient Colors:** The hero card gradient must ALWAYS use the dark mode gradient colors, regardless of the theme.
- **Header Icon Color:** Header icons (in app bars, etc.) must use `AppTheme.headerIconColor` to automatically switch between black (for light themes) and white (for dark themes) based on the background luminance.
- **"Add Job" and "Restore Deleted Jobs" Buttons:** In the "My Jobs" section of the settings screen, the text on these buttons should use `AppTheme.adaptiveTextColor` to switch between white and black based on the current theme.
- **"Export PDF" and "Export CSV" Options:** In the stats screen's export dropdown, the text on these options should use `AppTheme.adaptiveTextColor` to switch between white and black based on the current theme.
- **"Clear Chat" Option:** In the chat assistant, the "Clear Chat" text should use `AppTheme.adaptiveTextColor` to switch between black in light mode and white in dark mode.
- **Job Tab Text Color:** When a job is selected in light mode, the text should be white for better visibility.
- **Job Filter/Period Filter Text Color:** When a job is selected, or one of the filters of day, week, month, year or all is selected on the hero card, the inner text should be white.

### Additional Hero Card Rules:
- **Hero Card Background:** Hero cards must maintain a distinct background even when in Light Mode. Use `AppTheme.heroCardBackground` which defaults to a dark color, but adapts to a lighter gray (`#3D3D3D`) in light mode to ensure visual harmony.
- **Hero Card Gradient Colors:** The hero card gradient must use the current theme's primary and accent colors, ensuring the gradient adapts to the selected theme while remaining visible.

### Correct Hero Card Implementation
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import '../theme/app_theme.dart';

/// Universal Hero Card widget - dark background with green/blue gradient
/// Used for dashboard earnings, shift summaries, job cards, etc.
class HeroCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget child;
  final EdgeInsets? padding;
  final EdgeInsets? margin;
  final double? borderRadius;

  const HeroCard({
    super.key,
    required this.child,
    this.padding,
    this.margin,
    this.borderRadius,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Detect if we're in light mode by checking background luminance
    final isLightMode = AppTheme.darkBackground.computeLuminance() > 0.5;

    return Container(
      margin: margin,
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: isLightMode
            ? const Color(0xFF5A5A5A) // Light mode: #5A5A5A (adjust lighter/darker as needed)
            : const Color(0xFF1A1A1A), // Dark mode: #1A1A1A
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(borderRadius ?? AppTheme.radiusXL),
      ),
      child: Container(
        padding: padding ?? const EdgeInsets.all(24),
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          gradient: LinearGradient(
            begin: Alignment.topLeft,
            end: Alignment.bottomRight,
            colors: [
              AppTheme.primaryGreen.withOpacity(0.15),
              AppTheme.accentBlue.withOpacity(0.1),
            ],
          ),
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(borderRadius ?? AppTheme.radiusXL),
          border: Border.all(
            color: AppTheme.primaryGreen.withOpacity(0.3),
            width: 1,
          ),
        ),
        child: child,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Web Deployment Instructions (NEW - December 31, 2025):

These steps are a **general guide** based on past experiences. Actual deployment may require adjustments.

#### 1. Set the Base Href:

-   Before building for the web, ALWAYS specify the base href:
    ```bash
    flutter build web --release --base-href=/in-the-biz-ai/
    ```
-   This tells the app where it will be hosted.

#### 2. Verify `manifest.json`:

*   Ensure the `web/manifest.json` file exists and is correctly formatted JSON.
*   Double-check the paths to icons.

#### 3. Enable Google Sign-In for Web:

-   In `lib/services/auth_service.dart`, make sure the Google Sign-In logic is correctly implemented for web.
-   Use the correct client ID for web.
*  On web you can't use `authenticate()` - you MUST use the Google button rendered by the SDK.

#### 4. Create a GitHub Repository:

*   Create a new public repository on GitHub (e.g., `in-the-biz-ai`).
*   Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license.

#### 5. Configure Git:

```powershell
cd "c:\\Users\\Brandon 2021\\Desktop\In The Biz AI"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-username]/in-the-biz-ai.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### 6. Create and Deploy to `gh-pages` Branch:

```powershell
flutter build web --release --base-href=/in-the-biz-ai/
git checkout -b gh-pages
git add build/web
git commit -m "Deploy web app to GitHub Pages"
git push origin gh-pages --force
```

#### 7. Enable GitHub Pages:

*   Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
*   Navigate to the "Pages" section.
*   Set the source to the `gh-pages` branch.
*   Set the folder to `/build/web`.

#### 8. Test Thoroughly:

*   Access the deployed app via the GitHub Pages URL.
*   Test Google Sign-In.
*   Check for any errors in the browser console.

#### Troubleshooting:

*   **404 Errors:** Double-check the base href, file paths, and GitHub Pages settings.
*   **Google Sign-In Issues:** Ensure the web client ID is correctly configured and that the implementation follows the latest `google_sign_in` package guidelines.
*    **Large File Errors:** Make sure to exclude large files and folders like `node_modules` and `.dart_tool` from the repo.

#### 9. Deploy to Custom Domain (NEW - December 31, 2025):

To deploy to your custom domain `inthebiz.app`, you need to configure GitHub Pages to use that domain:

1.  **Add a CNAME file** to your `gh-pages` branch:
    *   Create a file named `CNAME` (no extension) in the `build/web` directory.
    *   Put one line in it: `inthebiz.app`
    *   Commit and push it

2.  **Update your DNS records** at your domain registrar (Vercel Domains):
    *   Go to your domain settings
    *   Add these CNAME records:
        *   `@` → `munzer221.github.io` (or use the A records GitHub provides if CNAME isn't supported)

3.  **Enable HTTPS** in GitHub Pages:
    *   Go to your repo Settings → Pages
    *   Check "Enforce HTTPS" (after GitHub Pages recognizes your domain)

### Security Rules (NEW - December 31, 2025):

- **NEVER commit `.env` files to Git.** These files contain sensitive API keys and credentials.
- **ALWAYS add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.** This prevents accidental commits.
- **When creating new API keys, restrict their usage** to only the necessary services (e.g., Generative Language API for Gemini).
- **Rotate API keys immediately** if they are compromised (e.g., accidentally committed to a public repository).
- **Monitor API key usage** in the cloud console to detect suspicious activity.
- **For web deployments, configure Docker Desktop to start automatically** to ensure the Supabase CLI and other tools function correctly.
- **When using Docker on Windows, restart the terminal** after installing Docker Desktop to ensure the Supabase CLI and other tools function correctly.

## 🗄️ SUPABASE DATABASE MIGRATIONS (NEW - December 31, 2025)

**DO NOT use `supabase db push` or `supabase migration up`** - these require Docker and are unreliable on Windows.

### How to Run SQL Migrations:

**Use the Node.js Script (Only Method):**
```powershell
node scripts/run-migration.mjs <migration-file>.sql
```

**Example:**
```powershell
node scripts/run-migration.mjs supabase/migrations/20251231000000_create_chat_messages.sql
```

### Required Setup:

1. **Script Location:** `scripts/run-migration.mjs` (already created)
2. **SQL Files Location:** `supabase/migrations/` directory
3. **Required Packages:** `pg` and `dotenv` (already installed via `npm install pg dotenv`)
4. **Environment Variable:** `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` file

**DATABASE_URL format:**
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT-ID].supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

### How It Works:

The script (`scripts/run-migration.mjs`):
- Reads the SQL file from the migrations directory
- Connects directly to PostgreSQL using the `pg` npm package
- Executes the SQL in a transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK on error)
- Shows helpful error messages if it fails

### Getting the Database Password:

1. Go to: **https://app.supabase.com/project/[PROJECT-ID]/settings/database**
2. Click **"Reset Database Password"** (safe - only affects this project)
3. Copy the new password
4. Update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` with the new password
5. Run the migration

### Creating New Migrations:

1. Create a new SQL file in `supabase/migrations/`
2. **Naming format:** `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql` (e.g., `20251231235959_add_new_table.sql`)
3. Write your SQL with proper error handling
4. Run: `node scripts/run-migration.mjs supabase/migrations/[filename].sql`

### On Windows:

On Windows, configure Docker Desktop to start automatically to ensure the Supabase CLI and other tools function correctly. Restart the terminal after installing Docker Desktop to ensure the Supabase CLI and other tools function correctly.
