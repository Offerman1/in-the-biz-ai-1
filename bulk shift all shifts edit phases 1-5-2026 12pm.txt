🎯 FINAL BUILD PLAN - READY TO EXECUTE
✅ CONFIRMED: We Have All Database Infrastructure:
✅ Shifts table - has calendar_event_id column (for calendar sync tracking)
✅ Shift_attachments table - ready for document previews
✅ Calendar deletion services - GoogleCalendarService.deleteCalendarEvent() exists
✅ Shift model - has all necessary fields (jobId, date, totalIncome, etc.)
✅ NO DATABASE MIGRATIONS NEEDED - we can start building immediately!
🚀 BUILD SEQUENCE (Logical Dependency Order):
PHASE 1: Document Preview System (5-6 hours)
Why first: Independent feature, doesn't affect bulk operations

Create DocumentPreviewWidget (thumbnails for images/PDFs)
Create FullScreenDocumentViewer
Update ShiftAttachment model with preview helpers
Update attachment tiles in Add/Edit/Details screens
Add open_filex package to pubspec.yaml
Create AllDocumentsScreen for Settings
Link BEO attachments in Event Portfolio
PHASE 2: All Shifts Screen Foundation (3-4 hours)
Why second: Must exist before adding bulk features

Add "Select" toggle button in AppBar
Add collapsible filter bar (Date, Sort dropdowns)
Add search bar
Implement filter logic (date range, sorting)
Implement search logic (all fields except dollar amounts)
Save filter state (remember user preferences)
PHASE 3: Selection Mode (2-3 hours)
Why third: Required for bulk actions

Add _isSelectionMode state
Add checkboxes to shift cards (shown when in selection mode)
Track selected shifts (Set<String> of shift IDs)
Smart selection text ("5/22 selected", "Select All", "Deselect All")
Select All / Deselect All functionality
PHASE 4: Bulk Actions Bar (2 hours)
Why fourth: Now that selection works, add action UI

Bulk actions dropdown button (appears when items selected)
Bottom sheet with all bulk actions
Action buttons: Delete, Export, Change Job, Adjust Pay, Edit Fields, Move Date
PHASE 5: Delete Action (2-3 hours)
Why fifth: Most critical bulk action

PHASE 6: Export Action (2-3 hours)
Export selected shifts to CSV

File save/share functionality
Success confirmation
PHASE 7: Other Bulk Actions (4-5 hours)
Change Job: Preview screen → apply
Move Date: Date picker → update shifts
Adjust Pay: Input dialog → apply formula
Batch Edit Fields: Multi-field form → apply
PHASE 8: Settings Integration (1 hour)
Add "SHIFTS" section in settings
